#  Regression Analysis on Spending Patterns and Income of Indian Banks

This project investigates how different categories of spending impact the total income of Indian banks using multivariate linear regression. The analysis is based on publicly available financial data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 2016 to 2020.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Determine the effect of various spending patterns (e.g., interest paid, operating costs) on total bank income.
- **Methodology**: Performed multivariate linear regression to model the relationship between expenditures and income.
- **Data Source**: RBI Data Warehouse (2016â€“2020).
- **Language & Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

##  Features

- Cleaned and structured real-world financial data from RBI.
- Performed statistical analysis using multivariate linear regression.
- Visualized patterns in spending vs. income with bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Interpreted model coefficients to identify which expense categories drive income.
- Evaluated model performance with RÂ² score and residual analysis.
